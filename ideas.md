Ideas to implement:
- Limit messages to 100 max, by strategely removing from the center. so first 50 and then 25 and then 12 and then 6 and then 3 and then 1 and also on the other side so 50 and then 75 and then 87 and then 93 and then 96 and then 98 and then 99. This way it still looks like a smooth progress bar but it doesn't go over 100.
- Multiple fonts https://wiki.factorio.com/images/Fonts.png and max characters per font, as factorio has a limit of characters it's willing to render until it gives up on styling.
- Items selector like the factorio inventory from https://wiki.factorio.com/Template:Inventory?action=raw and https://wiki.factorio.com/Template:Inventory
- Abillity to import blueprints and turn them into settings on the page
- more ascii bars https://changaco.oy.lc/unicode-progress-bars/
