Ideas to implement:
- Multiple fonts https://wiki.factorio.com/images/Fonts.png and max characters per font, as factorio has a limit of characters it's willing to render until it gives up on styling.
- Abillity to import blueprints and turn them into settings on the page
- more ascii bars https://changaco.oy.lc/unicode-progress-bars/
